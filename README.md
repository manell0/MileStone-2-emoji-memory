# Introduction

- This small website was designed mainly for people who already like the Memory game.
  I also hope to attract people who like single games in general.

- The focus of the website is to create an easy way to reach people who want to play a game of memory. To make the game more attractive we check the number of clicks and time.

- The simplicity and small scale of the website is an important aspect to achieve an interest in bookmarking the return page.

- If you like patience game you will like this Emoji Memory Game

- This is the second of four Milestone projects that the developer must complete during his Full Stack web development program at The Code Institute.

- The most important requirements were to build an interactive front-end site. The site should respond to the users' actions, allowing users to actively engage with data, alter the way the site displays the information to achieve their preferred goals. [**HTML5**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML5) and [**CSS3**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CSS) and [**JavaScript**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/javascript).

### Strategy

With these goals in mind, a strategy table was created to determine the trade-off between importance and viability with the following results:

### Scope

- The site is for single game people who want to improve in that genre.

- Users who find this website are most certainly one who is looking for just and precisely for a Memory game.

#### A scope was defined into two categories:

- ##### Content Requirements

  - The user will be looking for:
    - Information and rules of the game
    - A quick way to play the game

- ##### Functionality Requirements
  - The user will be able to:
    - Easily navigate through the site in order to find the information they want.
    - Easily start and play the memory game.

### Structure

The information architecture was organized in a hierarchical tree structure in order to ensure that users could navigate through the site with ease and efficiency, with the following results:

### Skeleton

Wireframe mockup were created in a Figma Workspace with providing a positive user experience in mind:

## Design

### Color Scheme

The main colors used throughout the website are a mixture of dark green, White and orange.

Also has black text so that there will be a distinct difference, and it will be visible well.

The chosen color scheme are chosen to get a clear and nice view to integrate with.

- I Find the color combination on site [COLORS](https://coolors.co/)

### Typography

Font font-family: Architects Daughter is used throughout the website with Sans Serif as the fallback font in case of import failure.

- I use [Google fonts](https://fonts.google.com/) for my font used on the site

### Picture

The selected image on the home page is modern and simple, reflecting the look and feel of the page and the game.
The image is captivating and visually represents the site's theme.

The image on index.html is a combination of Code Institute and an happy emoji.

In the game itself, on the back Code Institute logo and on the front are used various emojis that I found under free emojis on google.com.

- The images provides alternative text to use if the element cannot be reproduced.

# Features

### Design Features

Each page on the website has a consistent responsive navigation system through simple links. As the site is only on two pages and some pop up (Modal), no navigation bar is needed.

#### Home Page and the Game Page

The home and game page have the same structure in terms of appearance, location and links.

### Existing Features

- Start Page with link to info and the game with a fancy image
- Game Page with the game surface

## Features to Implement in the future

- [x] Make sure that the best result of a game can be saved in a separate file.

        High Score are done, finished and ready!

Corrected with https://www.corrector.co/

- #### Reason for not featuring in this release
  - ~~Time and skill...~~

# Issues and Bugs

- Problems getting my shuffle function to charge right from the start. Solution was to use [IIFE](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/IIFE)

- Some problem to set up my Modals. Solution [modal exempel use](https://www.w3schools.com/howto/howto_css_modals.asp)

- Problems getting 404.html working no matter where it goes wrong. 404.html works (https://manell0.github.io/MileStone-2-emoji-memory/adsfadfadfadfadfadf) but not if I do slash (/) after the whole URL (https://manell0.github.io/MileStone- 2-emoji-memory / index.html /).Tried to addÂ .htaccess file with the content (ErrorDocument 404 https://manell0.github.io/MileStone-2-emoji-memory/index.html/404.html) but it does not work ?! Tried to put 404.html in all directories, but it does not work ?! Unfortunately I have not found a solution to this problem, so maybe I have a bug ?.
