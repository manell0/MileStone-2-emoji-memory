# Introduction

- This small website was designed mainly for people who already like the Memory game.
  I also hope to attract people who like single games in general.

- The focus of the website is to create an easy way to reach people who want to play a game of memory. To make the game more attractive we check the number of clicks and time.

- The simplicity and small scale of the website is an important aspect to achieve an interest in bookmarking the return page.

- If you like single-game you will like this Emoji Memory Game

- This is the second of four Milestone projects that the developer must complete during his Full-Stack web development program at The Code Institute.

- The most important requirements were to build an interactive front-end site. The site should respond to the users' actions, allowing users to actively engage with data, alter the way the site displays the information to achieve their preferred goals. [**HTML5**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML5) and [**CSS3**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CSS) and [**JavaScript**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/javascript).

# UX

## Ideal User Demographic

### The ideal user of this website is

- People who already like single games and patience games.
- People who want to develop their memory skills and in a fun way can kill some time.
- Users who like single games in general.
- People who simply want to spend some time in a developing and fun way.

## User Stories

### New/Potential Fans Goals:

1. As a new user, I want to be able to easily start the game and also be able to develop their skill by seeing how many clicks you have made in what time.

2. As a new user, I want to be able to find out how the game should be played and what it is about.

3. As a new user, I want to be able to see my best result. How many clicks and what time.

4. As a new user, I want to be able to pause the game.

5. As a new user, I want to be able to restart the game.

6. As a new user, I want to be able to mute the sound in the game.

7. As a new user, I want to be able to close the game and get directly to the front page.

### Current Fans Goals:

1. As a current user, I want to navigate to the game as easily and quickly as possible.

2. As a current user, I want to be able to see my high score simply.

### Strategy

With these goals in mind, a strategy table was created to determine the trade-off between importance and viability with the following results:

**_[Link to Strategy Trade-off as PDF](assets/readme-resources/strategy-trade-off.pdf)_**

![Spreadsheet Strategy](assets/readme-resources/strategy-trade-off.jpg)

### Scope

- The site is for single-game people who want to improve in that genre.

- Users who find this website are most certainly one who is looking for just and precisely for a Memory game.

#### A scope was defined into two categories:

- ##### Content Requirements

  - The user will be looking for:
    - Information and rules of the game
    - A quick way to play the game

- ##### Functionality Requirements
  - The user will be able to:
    - Easily navigate through the site to find the information they want.
    - Easily start and play the memory game.

### Structure

The information architecture was organized in a hierarchical tree structure to ensure that users could navigate through the site with ease and efficiency, with the following results:

![Hierarchical tree structure](assets/readme-resources/Structure.jpg)

### Skeleton

Wireframe mockup was created in a Figma Workspace with providing a positive user experience in mind:

## Design

### Color Scheme

The main colors used throughout the website are a mixture of dark green, white, and orange.

Also has black text so that there will be a distinct difference, and it will be visible well.

The chosen color scheme is chosen to get a clear and nice view to integrate with.

- I find the color combination on-site [COLORS](https://coolors.co/)

### Typography

Font font-family: Architects Daughter is used throughout the website with Sans Serif as the fallback font in case of import failure.

- I use [Google fonts](https://fonts.google.com/) for my font used on the site

### Picture

The selected image on the home page is modern and simple, reflecting the look and feel of the page and the game.
The image is captivating and visually represents the site's theme.

The image on index.html is a combination of Code Institute and a happy emoji.

In the game itself, on the back Code Institute logo and the front are used various emojis that I found under free emojis on google.com.

- The images provide alternative text to use if the element cannot be reproduced.

# Features

### Design Features

Each page on the website has a consistent responsive navigation system through simple links. As the site is only on two pages and some pop up (Modal), no navigation bar is needed.

#### Home Page and the Game Page

The home and game pages have the same structure in terms of appearance.

### Existing Features

#### The website consists of two pages with associated Modal for both pages (index.html and game.html).

- ### Start Page (index.html):
  - Link on top of the start page to info **Info About The Game** (Modal).
    - Here you can see information about the game. You can also see your best result (if you previously played in the same browser, using local storage o save values) as well as links to the game and back to the home page.
  - At the top in the center of the page you have a fancy image/logo.
    - The image is clickable and you get to the info page (Modal).
    - Link at the bottom of the start page to the game **Start Memory Game**.
    - Start the memory game immediately.
- ### Game Page (game.html):
  - At the top left is the timer clock with seconds and tenths.
  - In the middle of the game page we find three icons/buttons:
    - The first button is the pause/start button:
      - Are used if you want to pause the game during the current game.
    - The second button is the restart button:
      - Are used to restart the game.
    - The third button is mute or unmute button:
      - Are used to mute or unmute in the game.
  - At the top right is an exit button that closes the game and redirects the user to the home page (index.html).
  - In the middle of the page is the playing surface where the game itself is played

The Modal that appears when you finish the game shows the round's number of clicks and the time it took to complete the game.
Also, the record the user has (if there is a previous record).
At the bottom of the Modal we find two links that go to **Play Again** and **Back To Main**

- ### 404 page (404.html):
  - 404 looks similar to the start page with the difference that it is a shocking emoji as the center image instead of a happy emoji as it is on the start page. When you click on the image or text, you get to the start page.

## Features to Implement in the future

- [x] Make sure that the best result of a game can be saved and stored.

**High Score is finish and ready!** üëç

- #### Reason for not featuring in this release
  - ~~Time and skill...~~

# Issues and Bugs

- Problems getting my shuffle function to charge right from the start.

  - Solution was to use [IIFE](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/IIFE)

- Some problem to set up my Modals.

  - Solution [modal exempel use](https://www.w3schools.com/howto/howto_css_modals.asp)

- Problems getting 404.html working no matter where it goes wrong. 404.html works (https://manell0.github.io/MileStone-2-emoji-memory/adsfadfadfadfadfadf) but not if I do slash (/) after the whole URL (https://manell0.github.io/MileStone- 2-emoji-memory / index.html /).Tried to add .htaccess file with the content (ErrorDocument 404 https://manell0.github.io/MileStone-2-emoji-memory/index.html/404.html) but it does not work ?! Tried to put 404.html in all directories, but it does not work ?!

  - SOLUTION: I changed all relative file paths in 404.html to absolute file paths and that solved my problem. So now 404.html works as it should! üòÄ

- Problems with my javascript code appearing with 8 spaces when looking in GitHub. Apparently can not be changed.

  - Solution: You can append ?ts=2 or ?ts=4 to the URL to change the tab-size.

- This was an issue [How to Write a Git Commit Message](https://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/) Of course, I would read this before I did this project!
